# React: Review & Things I wish I knew earlier

## **Part 1 Profile Cards - AppProfile**

1. learning how to create props
2. when trying to make box shadow --> use this [useful site](https://cssgenerator.org/box-shadow-css-generator.html)
3. Event Handling in React
   1. [React Official Docs](https://react.dev/learn/responding-to-events)
   2. Important: Functions passed to event handlers must be passed, not called.
      1. Correct :<span class="colour" style="color:rgb(235, 236, 240)">\<button onClick={handleClick}></span>
      2. Wrong :Â <span class="colour" style="color:rgb(235, 236, 240)">\<button onClick={handleClick()}></span>

## **Part 2 Counter App - CounterApp**

1. Creating a Counter app using react use State.
2. Parent has 2 counter children
   1. parent passes down state method to children so that children can modify parent state.
3. What is a state? any data that needs to change within the UI

## **Part 3 Product App - AppProduct**

**1.**[UseEffect]**runs on every render so make sure to add second parameter**
**\- when fetching from api\, fetch inside useEffect\.**

```js
useEffect(() => {
  //Runs only on the first render
}, []);

useEffect(() => {
  //Runs on the first render
  //And any time any dependency value changes
}, [prop, state]);
```

2\. Iteration in jsx \-\-\> should always contain a key value

```js
{
  product.map((product) => <li key={product.id}>....</li>);
}
```

## **Part 4 Pointer App**

- when 2 state values are related use object

  - Instead of this:
    - `Const [x,setX] = useState(0)`
    - `Const [y,setX] = useState(0)`
  - Do this:
    - `Const [points,setPoints] = useState({x:0,y:0})`

- using event handler in React same as HTML.
- when using css value that changes use with inline style

## **Part 5 Mentor App - AppMenors**

- Practice using useReducer
- useReducer is like reducer array method in javascript but for objects.
- JavaScript Reducer Example:
  ```js
  const numbers = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5];
  const sum = numbers.reduce(
    (accumulator, currentValue) => accumulator + currentValue,
    0
  );
  ```
- UseReducer
  ```js
  UseReducer(reducer, initialState);
  newState = reducer(currentState, action);
  ```

## **Part 6 Counter 2 Using UseReducer - Counter2App**

- A more simple implementation of useReducer, still needs practice...

## **Part 7 Handling Forms - FormApp**

- **_Uncontrolled Component_** When there are values changing in the UI but there is no state that is observing it.
- in Forms, UI changes but we need a way to observe state changes.
- ```js
  const handleChange = (e) => {
  const { name, value } = e.target;
  setFrom({ ...form, [name]: value });
  ```
- in the form, we have separate name and value keys to determine what part to change.

## **Part 8 Higher Order Components(HOC) - HOCApp**

- a function that takes a component and returns a new component with additional properties or behaviors.
- ```js
  <Card>
    <p>Card1</p>
  </Card>
  ```

## **Part 9 Context API - AppTheme**

- Prop Drilling : process in React where data is passed from one part of the tree to another by going through multiple levels of components
- In order to reduce prop drilling we use the useContext Hook in React.
- kind of like a service in Ember.js
- create context and provider.
- You want to set an umbrella to components that share the state.
- ```js
  const { darkMode, toggleDarkMode } = useContext(DarkModeContext);
  ```

## **Part 10 React Custom Hooks - CustomHookApp**

- Custom hooks are just functions that start with "use" and can call other hooks. The primary reason to use custom hooks is to encapsulate and extract component logic into reusable functions.
- Inside the Hook Function always return the functions or values you want to use throughout the program.
- `function useLocalStorage(key, initialValue)`
- `return [value, setStoredValue, removeStoredValue];`
- inside the component
  - `const [name, setName, removeName] = useLocalStorage('name', 'mike')`
- the LHS is the return values, and RHS is the props that is being passed to the custom hook.

## **Part 11 React Router -RouterApp**

- [Official Docs]("https://reactrouter.com/en/main/start/tutorial")
- create a separate page folder, this is where your pages will go.
- In the main page, use the `RouterProvider, createBrowserRouter` hooks provided by React Router.
- ```js
  const router = createBrowserRouter([
    {
      path: "/",
      element: <Root />,
      errorElement: <NotFound />,
      children: [
        { index: true, element: <div>Home</div> },
        { path: "videos", element: <Videos /> },
        { path: "videos/:videoId", element: <VideoDetail /> },
      ],
    },
  ]);
  ```
  `return <RouterProvider router={router} />;`
- Add the following pages in pages file
- Adding an outlet: Everything inside the outlet will change. Add this inside the root file /  
  - ```js
    <div>
      <NavBar />
      <Outlet />
    </div>
    ```
- Adding extra parameters --> ` { path: "videos/:videoId", element: <VideoDetail /> },`
- inside the file use the `useNavigate` hook. 
  - `const navigate = useNavigate();`
  - ```navigate(`/videos/${text}`);```
- inside the child page, you can access the parameter value using the `useParams` hook
  - `const {videoId} = useParams();`
